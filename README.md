# Intro to Django

We're about to learn our second web framework, Django. Django is a full-featured
framework for building complex web applications with ease and speed.

We'll learn the core features of Django and how to build web apps "the Django
way."

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

* Discuss the core features of Django
* Compare and contrast building applications with Django and Express
* Walk through how Django handles the request-response cycle

## What is Django? (5 min / 0:05)

As defined in the [official documentation](https://www.djangoproject.com/), "Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source."

Django is a web framework that is know for its speed, security, scalability and versatility. It also comes with a lot of extra features that, although may have a learning curve when it comes to becoming familiar with using them, make your life as a developer a lot easier, eliminating a lot of the hard coding you may have had to do in the past to implement the same functionality.

### Background (5 min / 0:10)

Created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, developers at the Lawrence Journal World Newspaper, Django was born out of frustrations the developers had working with PHP. Working for the publication, applications often had to be created very quickly, sometimes within a few hours, and Holovaty and Willison needed a tool to accomplish just that, while keeping the development process clean and maintainable. They wanted to move from PHP to building with Python, but none of the tools and technologies that were around at the time came with the features they wanted - things like CSS, well designed URLs, the way the request/response cycle would work, and deployment. 

Although the initial intention may not have been to create a new web framework, Django proved itself to be an extremely useful and dynamic tool, and the World Company (who owned the newspaper) agreed to open source it. And the rest is history!

### Companies Using Django

Several companies have subscribed to the magic of Django, including many that you may have heard of like Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Onion, Bitbucket, Dropbox, Eventbrite and Prezi.

What are the benefits that these companies see in building their applications with the popular framework?

1. It's highly customizable - new features are easy to implement, giving every application the ability to be unique and stand out.
1. It's scalable - the dream of any business is to grow. When an application is built with Django, the framework doesn't have to change in order for it's size to expand with the business.
1. It's simple and fast - apps can get off the ground faster because the structure is simple, and and Django has a reputation to be quick for development.

## Conclusion

Throughout the week, we will be building a few full stack applications with Django. Think about that for a moment. So far, we have spent entire units learning out to build out different parts of an application, from the front end to the back end and putting everything together. Using Django, we will be able to follow the pattern of MVC that we already became familiar with in Express to build out dynamic projects in a (much) shorter amount of time!
